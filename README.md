Discrete mathematics is a field that explores mathematical structures fundamentally characterized by their discreteness, as opposed to the continuous nature of real numbers. While real numbers vary smoothly, objects in discrete mathematics, such as integers, graphs, and logical statements, possess distinct, separated values.

In the project, you can leverage discrete mathematics to address three crucial divisions. Despite the rapid surge of the coronavirus pandemic, which has made obtaining specific data challenging, we have harnessed various global resources providing graphs and approximate data. These resources have enabled us to develop our analyses with the assistance of diverse tools.

Our process begins by converting the provided resource into an Excel file. Subsequently, we employ a Python code to calculate the daily count of new cases, utilizing inputs such as current test results, recoveries, and fatalities.

Moving beyond the initial division, where we calculate present cases, we delve into more intricate analyses. Using the Excel sheet, we conduct various data manipulations, including generating graphs and performing complex calculations. This data is then imported into SQL, where we apply a range of functions to yield precise and explicit outcomes.

Given the urgency of the pandemic's spread and the need to optimize hospital resources, we tackle another critical aspect. This involves creating schedules for doctors and nurses, ensuring efficient patient care. These schedules are meticulously crafted with specific shifts and duties, allowing us to monitor and enhance the overall work efficiency of medical staff, thus maximizing patient recovery rates.

Throughout this project, we have leveraged numerous libraries, executed extensive coding and statistical analyses, fine-tuned data, and provided practical solutions to enhance the efficiency of hospital operations during these challenging times.
